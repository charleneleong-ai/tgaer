# TGAER – Toward General-Purpose Abstraction & Embodied Reasoning

Monorepo for experiments on ARC-style abstraction and ORAK embodied reasoning
with LLM agents, DSPy programs, and GEQ optimization with MLflow/LangSmith.


This repository contains code and resources for the TGAER project, which aims to
develop general-purpose abstraction and embodied reasoning capabilities using
large language models (LLMs), domain-specific programming (DSPy), and optimisation
techniques.

## Repository Structure
- `agents/`: Contains implementations of LLM agents for reasoning and problem-solving.
- `dspy/`: Domain-Specific Programming in Python for defining and executing tasks.
- `geq/`: GEQ optimization framework for tuning model parameters and strategies.
- `experiments/`: Scripts and configurations for running experiments and benchmarks.
- `docs/`: Documentation and resources related to the project.
